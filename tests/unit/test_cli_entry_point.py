# HCR-C2-002 — Unit Tests: Marketplace entry point (cli.py)
#
# cli.py is not imported by any other module, so nothing else in the suite would notice if its
# import path, its graph class, or its runtime-config assembly broke — the image would build and
# then fail when the Pod starts. These exercise it directly, including the `__main__` block that
# the image's CMD actually runs.
#
# Skipped where the platform events package is absent: shared.bootstrap.marketplace_app imports it
# at module level, so cli.py cannot be imported at all in that environment.
