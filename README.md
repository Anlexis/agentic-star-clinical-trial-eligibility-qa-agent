# Clinical Trial Eligibility Q&A Agent

AI agent for answering clinical trial eligibility questions, built with Agentic Star.

> **Category**: Cat 2 (domain-specific pipeline)
> **Industry**: Healthcare
> **Template ID**: HCR-C2-002

## Overview

Pre-screens de-identified patient criteria against the inclusion/exclusion rules of a
clinical-trial protocol. A trial coordinator or research nurse submits de-identified
patient-criteria text (age, diagnosis, lab values, prior treatment) plus a trial identifier;
the agent retrieves every criterion of that trial from a seeded protocol knowledge base,
classifies each one against a deliberately hedged status vocabulary, and returns a cited,
criterion-by-criterion advisory assessment. It is decision-support only: it never issues an
eligibility verdict or enrollment decision, it abstains on low-confidence or
unidentified-trial input, and every output carries a mandatory principal-investigator (PI)
review disclaimer. The pipeline is deterministic (keyword and negation-aware term matching
over the seeded knowledge base) — no live LLM call, vector store, or EMR/registry
integration.

This is an agent template built with the **AGENTIC STAR** development platform and the
**AgentCore Framework**. It is intended to be taken as a starting point: fork it, adapt it to
your own data and policies, and run it inside your own AGENTIC STAR deployment.

## Requirements

**This template does not run standalone.** It requires:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AGENTIC STAR platform** | The agent connects to the platform at start-up. Without it, start-up fails immediately (see *Behaviour without the platform* below). Deployment guides and API documentation: [AGENTIC STAR Developers](https://developers.fd.agenticstar.tm.softbank.jp/) |
| **AgentCore Framework** (`agenticstar-agentcore`) | Installed from PyPI as a dependency. |
| Python | >=3.11 |

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Behaviour without the platform

The framework is designed to run **only** on AGENTIC STAR. There is no fallback or degraded
mode. If the platform is unreachable or the SDK version does not match, the agent fails
at graph compile / start-up preflight rather than starting in a partially
working state. This is intentional — a half-running agent is worse than one that refuses to start.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests run without a platform connection. Running the agent itself does not.

## Project Structure

```
src/          agent implementation (nodes, services, schemas)
tests/        unit, integration and boundary tests
config/       agent configuration
docs/         design and operational documentation
```

See `docs/` for the design specification and test specification.

## Customising

1. Adjust `config/` for your own environment and policies.
2. Replace the knowledge sources and sample data with your own.
3. Review the node implementations under `src/nodes/` for domain-specific logic.
4. Re-run the test suite.
